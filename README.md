### Abstract
Currently, the deployment of conversational agents in the financial sector is predominately focused on handling transactional inquiries in the customer service domain. This approach is associated with the issues of marginalizing customer service employees by reinforcing the societal bias of “low-value” work, dehumanizing and concealing their labour behind machines, and reinforcing gender and professional stereotypes. Furthermore, the deployment of these conversational agents contributes to product differentiation based on wealth by digitizing services for general customers. In light of these problems, we advocate for leveraging conversational agents’ capabilities for more inclusive design and discuss the corresponding avenues.
